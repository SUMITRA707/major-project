Major Project
A versatile project repository hosting a microservice-based solution, starting with a universal logging hook microservice. This project aims to provide a scalable framework for capturing, storing, and visualizing log events from various applications.
Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Python-based microservice designed to handle logging operations. The initial focus is on a logging hook that accepts log events via HTTP and provides a dashboard for real-time log inspection. Future enhancements may include integration with external log aggregators and advanced analytics.
Prerequisites

Git: Install from git-scm.com.
Python 3.10+: Install from python.org.
pip: Included with Python (upgrade with python -m pip install --upgrade pip).
Docker: Install Docker Desktop from docker.com.
Optional: A code editor like VS Code (code.visualstudio.com) and tools like Postman or curl for testing.

Setup
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/SUMITRA707/major-project.git
cd major-project

2. Navigate to the Subproject

For the logging microservice, move to the subdirectory:cd universal-logging-hook-microservice


Follow the specific setup instructions in that folder's README (to be added).

3. Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv venv
# Activate: Windows - venv\Scripts\activate; macOS/Linux - source venv/bin/activate


Install required packages (update requirements.txt as needed):pip install -r requirements.txt



4. Configure the Project

Check the config folder for configuration files (e.g., config.yaml). If none exist, create one with settings like:log_level: DEBUG
port: 5000


Set environment variables (optional, via .env file):FLASK_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
PORT=5000



5. Run the Project

Local Run: Execute the main script (e.g., python dashboard.py or python src/app.pyâ€”adjust based on your entry point).
Docker Run: Build and start containers:docker-compose up --build


Access the service (e.g., http://localhost:5000 if using port 5000).

6. Test the Project

Send a test log event:curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/log -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"level": "INFO", "message": "Test log entry"}'


Check logs or the dashboard (details in subproject README).
